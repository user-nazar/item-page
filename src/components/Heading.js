                <Header>A possible transfer of Ukrainian player for MU!
                        <p> Talented <q> Dynamo </q> defender Vitaliy Mykolenko could join <q> Manchester United </q>.
                            But Kyiv did not like the amount offered by the British for the young player.
                            The English club offered <q> Dynamo </q> bosses to hire a defender with a mandatory right of
                            redemption.
                            It is not yet reported how much <q> Manchester United </q> were willing to pay for Mykolenko,
                            but the amount seems to have been very substantial.
                            The leadership of Kyiv wants to raise about 40 million euros for a key defense player.
                            The British did not want to pay such a crazy amount. Therefore, they were refused.
                            This season, Mykolenko played 11 matches in a "blue and white" T-shirt, in which he twice
                            assisted his teammates.
                            Recently, there was information that the football giant <q> Milan </q> became seriously
                            interested in the footballer.
                            The Italians continue to closely monitor the game of the 21-year-old defender.
                            We will add that Mykolenko made his debut for the adult <q> Dynamo </q> team in the summer of
                            2017 and almost immediately began to show his best qualities.
                            Thanks to a good game in 2018, he deserved a call to the national team of Ukraine from Andriy
                            Shevchenko..</p>
